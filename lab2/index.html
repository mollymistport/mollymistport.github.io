		<div class="stepDescription">
			<p>A wine opener- or corkscrew- is the main tool to open a bottle of wine.  If there is foil around the neck of the bottle, take that off with the knife on the corkscrew.  Proceed to insert the corkscrew into  the cork, and twist down until the screw is fully inside the cork. Believe it or not, there is a variety of wine openers out there!<a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/cooking-tools/g34145848/best-wine-openers/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=arb_ga_ghk_d_bm_g34145848&gclid=Cj0KCQjwpreJBhDvARIsAF1_BU0JvkXjveVkkShDK2Ipliu5S9tlhSzkmHTt0A7DKWEVyXp0z-ZOVSIaAlDaEALw_wcB"> This article from Good Housekeeping </a>provides some insight on the best corkscrews to purchase. </p>

			Step 4: Pour wine in glass
		</summary>

		<div class="stepContent">

		<div class="stepDescription">
			<p> Pick up the bottle of wine and pour the wine into a glass leaving about 2/3 of the glass empty.  This will enable you to swirl the wine around and smell it before tasting.  Certain wine glasses are made for certain types of wine.  <a href="https://winefolly.com/tips/the-importance-of-a-proper-wine-glass/">Read this article </a>to learn about which glassware is suitable for the type of wine you picked!</p>

		<div class="stepDescription">
			<p>Swirl the glass of wine and smell it.  It should smell of various fruits, minerals and earthy nuances depending on the wine you choose.  Then, take one sip of the wine, and swoosh it around your palate.  Then take a second sip of wine to fully acclimate your palate to the wine.   This is just the beginning of deductive tasting, which we will cover in future job aids.
